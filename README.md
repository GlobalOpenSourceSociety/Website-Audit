# Website Audit

It's a series of reports that you can use to analyse if your or others' site follows best practices.

The list of best practices was collected by myself over five years of research and work in the web development industry. However, I don't pretend to know everything. I want to share with you what I have learned over the years.

I am hoping that I inspire you enough to share with all readers of these reports your thought, experiences and best practices that you follow when improving a website.
