## 3. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)

### Overview

HTTPS encrypts the connection between a user and your website, securing any sensitive data that the user may have submitted on your site, such as personal details, password, and credit cards. It ensures that you really are talking to the server you think you're connected to and that no one can listen in on the conversation.

Without encryption, a user is exposed to a â€˜man-in-the-middle' attack. This is where a hacker can obtain sensitive information during the process of sending them from a user to your system. Personal information exposed in this way can lead to serious problems for your customers.

## 4. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

### Overview

HTTP Strict Transport Security (aka HSTS) helps speed up the firs page load of your site when you have installed an SSL certificate for your domain, and a user requests an unsecured version of your URL. This can occur when a searcher types in the address of your page (e.g. example.ie) or clicks on a link to HTTP version (e.g. http://<span></span>example.ie/page/). Then your server needs to correct the request and redirect the user to the secured version of the page (if your server is set up correctly). 

You can avoid this delay by using HSTS which asks browsers to automatically load the HTTPS version of your site, each time someone requests a page.
