## 1.1. Favicon

**Overview**

Favicon is the small graphic that appears in your browser window or at the top of the browser
tab. This is not a ranking factor, but various sites, mobile devices, social media platforms, and
distribution sites will use a Favicon when displaying your site. For this reason, it is beneficial to
have a high-quality Favicon that is clearly displayed on your site.
